The standard WordPress trackback link behavior does not provide users their expected result. wp-TrackbackPopup resolves this issue.  It uses unobtrusive JavaScript to cause a popup window when a user clicks the trackback link.  The popup provides a text version of the trackback URL for easy copying and pasting.

== Description ==

From the authors of [wp-Typography](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-typography/) comes wp-TrackbackPopup.

In WordPress the default trackback link behavior causes persistent user confusion.  Knowledgeable users right-click on the link and copy the link location.  But the vast majority of users click the link &mdash; expecting to copy the link from the browser's location bar &mdash;  only to be redirected back to the very page they were on. The standard implementation does not provide the expected result. 

wp-​​TrackbackPopup resolves this issue. It uses unob­tru­sive JavaScript to create a popup win­dow when a user clicks the track­back link. The popup window pro­vides a text ver­sion of the track­back URL for easy copy­ing and pasting.
The popup window may be styled to match your existing theme.
